Combine model outputs into single files with key column

Refactor model evaluation outputs to write combined files instead of
separate per-key directories. Each output file now contains results
from all keys with a 'key' column for filtering.

Changes:

bin/model_functions.R:
- run_emmeans_weighted(): Returns named list of dataframes with key column
- run_emmeans_label(): Returns named list of dataframes with key column
- run_and_store_model(): Changed param from key_dir to fig_dir, returns
  all results instead of writing files

bin/model_performance_aggregated.R:
- Collects results across all keys in loop
- Combines by result name and writes to formula_dir/files/*.tsv

bin/model_performance_label.R:
- Handles returned results and writes them to files

bin/plot_pub_figures.py:
- Added --primary_key argument (default: subclass)
- Filters combined files by key where needed
- Updated load_method_emmeans() to handle single combined file

modules/local/model_eval_aggregated/main.nf:
- Updated output patterns for new file structure

modules/local/model_eval_label/main.nf:
- Updated output patterns for new file structure

modules/local/plot_pub_figures/main.nf:
- Simplified inputs to handle combined files

workflows/evaluation_summary.nf:
- Simplified channel handling (no filtering by parent directory)

New output structure:
  formula_dir/
    files/
      model_coefs.tsv
      method_emmeans_summary.tsv
      reference_method_emmeans_summary.tsv
      method_cutoff_effects.tsv
      ...
    figures/
      key1/
      key2/
      ...
