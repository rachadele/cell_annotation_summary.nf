why do individual labels perform better with seurat, but fitted values from the random effect model favor scvi?
we are fitting to weighted average f1 scores, which give more weight to cell types with more support
>fit to macro average f1 instead?
>somehow incorporate number of total cells per cell type into the plot, like maybe with size of dots on the forest plot, so we can see which cell types get more weight?
